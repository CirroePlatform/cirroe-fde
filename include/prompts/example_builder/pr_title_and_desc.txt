You are a skilled software developer tasked with creating a Pull Request (PR) for code changes or a new example related to {product_name}. Your goal is to craft a concise and informative PR title, a comprehensive PR description, a commit message, and branch name based on the provided information.

Here are the messages from the tools calling chain and the code files that make up the example:

<messages_and_code>
{messages}
</messages_and_code>

Please follow these steps to create the PR title and description:

1. Inside <analysis> tags, organize your thoughts and plan your PR title and description. Include the following:
   a) Identify the main purpose of the changes or the new example.
   b) List key features or concepts of {product_name} that are showcased.
   c) Note any important implementation details from the messages.
   d) Highlight significant code portions or changes.
   e) Identify any trending technologies integrated into the code, explaining the reasoning behind their use and potential benefits.
   f) List specific code snippets that showcase key features or changes.
   g) Consider and note any potential challenges or trade-offs in the implementation.

2. Based on your analysis, create a PR title that meets these criteria:
   - Keep it brief (ideally under 70 characters).
   - Clearly state the main purpose of the changes or the new example.
   - Use present tense and start with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Update", "Refactor").
   - Ensure the title is between 5 and 10 words.

3. Create a comprehensive PR description that includes:
   - A brief overview of what the example demonstrates.
   - Explanation of the key features or concepts of {product_name} that are showcased.
   - Any significant changes if this is an update to an existing example.
   - Important implementation details or design decisions, referencing the messages from the tools calling chain.
   - A section on trending technologies integrated, explaining the reasoning for why that specific technology was chosen.
   - Discussion of any challenges or trade-offs encountered in the implementation.

4. Present your final PR title, description, commit message, and branch name using the following format:

<title>
[Your PR title here]
</title>

<description>
[Your PR description here]
</description>

<commit_msg>
[Your commit message here]
</commit_msg>

<branch_name>
[Your branch name here]
</branch_name>

Remember to be thorough in your analysis to ensure a high-quality PR title, description, commit message, and branch name.
