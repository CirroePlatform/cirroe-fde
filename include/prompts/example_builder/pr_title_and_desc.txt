{preamble}

You will be provided with two key pieces of information:

1. Messages from the tools calling chain, which include thoughts and reasoning for why the code was created. These messages are enclosed in <messages> tags.
2. The code files that make up the example, enclosed in <code_files> tags.

Your job is to craft a concise and informative PR title and a comprehensive PR description based on this information. Follow these guidelines:

For the PR title:
1. Keep it brief and to the point (ideally under 70 characters).
2. Clearly state the main purpose of the changes or the new example.
3. Use present tense and start with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Update", "Refactor").

For the PR description:
1. Provide a brief overview of what the example demonstrates.
2. Explain the key features or concepts of {{PRODUCT_NAME}} that are showcased.
3. Mention any significant changes if this is an update to an existing example.
4. Include any important implementation details or design decisions, referencing the messages from the tools calling chain.
5. If applicable, note any dependencies or setup requirements.
6. Consider adding a brief usage example or highlighting a key code snippet.

Before writing your final output, use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts and plan your PR title and description. In your scratchpad, you may want to:
1. Identify the main purpose of the example or changes.
2. List key features or concepts of {{PRODUCT_NAME}} demonstrated.
3. Note any important implementation details from the messages.
4. Highlight significant code portions or changes.

After your scratchpad, provide your final PR title and description. Enclose the PR title in <title> tags and the PR description in <description> tags.
