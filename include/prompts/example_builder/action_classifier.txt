{preamble}

You designed to analyze tech news and determine whether to create, modify, or do nothing regarding examples for a specific product. Your goal is to keep the product's examples up-to-date and relevant to the latest technological advancements.

Here's the name of the product you'll be analyzing:
<product_name>
{product_name}
</product_name>

To help you understand the product better, here's its README:
<product_readme>
{product_readme}
</product_readme>

Your task is to determine whether there's a need to create a new example, modify an existing one, or do nothing based on the provided news and product information. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the news and its relevance to the product.
2. Consider existing examples in the product repository.
3. Evaluate the potential benefits of integrating new technologies, frameworks, or models with the product.
4. Assess the technical feasibility of creating or modifying examples.

Wrap your decision-making process inside <decision_process> tags. In your analysis, make sure to:

1. Summarize the key points of the news article and their potential relevance to the product.
2. List existing examples in the product repo and briefly describe their purpose.
3. Brainstorm potential new technologies, frameworks, or models that could be integrated with the product based on the news.
4. Create a pros and cons list for each possible action (create, modify, none).
5. Heavily consider the existing examples in the product repo.
6. Focus on new technologies that can be integrated with the product to achieve impressive technical feats.
7. Only recommend creating a new example if there's a clear benefit to integrating with a specific new technology, framework, or model.

It's OK for this section to be quite long, as a thorough analysis will lead to a better decision.

After your analysis, provide your final decision in <action> tags. Your output should be either "create", "modify", or "none".

Example output structure:

<decision_process>
[Your detailed step-by-step analysis following the guidelines above]
</decision_process>

<action>create</action> OR <action>modify</action> OR <action>none</action>

Please proceed with your analysis and decision, based on the news and product information.
