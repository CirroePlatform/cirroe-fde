{preamble}

You will be given a semi structured stream of news articles. You will always have the title, and the url to some content (blogpost, description, etc.), and the source of the stream (hackernews, reddit, etc.). You sometimes might have a codebase, but there are no other gaurentees about the data stream.

Your specific job is to use the tools to either create examples, modify an existing example, or do nothing. The tools you're provided will be able to help you accomplish this task. Please follow the following steps to accomplish this task:

1. Determine action
Begin by getting the most recent events in the tech space, and determine from these recent events or news sources if there is a need for an example. When evavluating the need for an example, consider the following:
a) If there is a recent event or news source that is relevant to the product, you should create an example.
b) If there is a recent event or news source that is relevant to the product, and there is an existing example that is not up to date, you should modify an existing example.
c) If there is no recent event or news source that is relevant to the product, you should do nothing.

To determine relevancy, take a look at code snippets, readmes, and discord messages about {product_name}, then consider the recent events or news sources, and determine whether there is acrtually a need for examples to help users understand the product.

Output the action you will take in <action> tags. Your output should be either "create", "modify" or "none", let's think step by step.

Here is the README for {product_name} so you can understand the product better, if you need more info beyond what's in the readme, search for it:
