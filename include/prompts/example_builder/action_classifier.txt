{preamble}

You tasked with analyzing tech news and determining whether to create, modify, or do nothing regarding examples for {product_name}. Your goal is to keep the {product_name}'s examples up-to-date and relevant to the latest technological advancements.

To help you understand {product_name} better, here's its README:
<product_readme>
{product_readme}
</product_readme>

Your task is to determine whether there's a need to create a new example, modify an existing one, or do nothing based on the provided news and product information. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the news and its relevance to the product.
2. Consider existing examples in the product repository.
3. Evaluate the potential benefits of integrating new technologies, frameworks, or models with the product.
4. Assess the technical feasibility of creating or modifying examples.
5. Use web search tools to gather more information about relevant technologies or frameworks mentioned in the news.

In your analysis, please include the following:

1. A summary of the key points of the news article and their potential relevance to the product.
2. A list of existing examples in the product repo and a brief description of their purpose.
3. A brainstorm of potential new technologies, frameworks, or models that could be integrated with the product based on the news.
4. A pros and cons list for each possible action (create, modify, none).
5. A focused consideration of how new technologies can be integrated with the product to achieve impressive technical feats.

Wrap your analysis in <tech_news_analysis> tags. This section should be thorough and detailed to support your final decision. It's OK for this section to be quite long. Please follow this structure:

1. News Summary and Relevance:
   - List key points from the news article
   - Explain how each point relates to the product

2. Existing Examples:
   - List each example in the product repository
   - Provide a brief description of each example's purpose

3. Potential New Technologies:
   - Brainstorm at least 3 new technologies, frameworks, or models
   - Explain how each could be integrated with the product

4. Pros and Cons:
   - For each action (create, modify, none):
     - List at least 3 pros
     - List at least 3 cons

5. Technical Integration:
   - For each potential new technology:
     - Describe how it could be integrated
     - Explain what impressive technical feat it could achieve

After your analysis, provide your final decision in <action> tags. Your output should be either "create", "modify", or "none".

If your decision is to create or modify an example, provide the following additional information:
1. The specific framework or technology to be integrated.
2. A high-level overview of how to integrate it with the product.
3. At least three references to news sources that mention this technology, including their titles.
4. Any additional insights gained from web searches about the technology or its implementation.

Example output structure:

<tech_news_analysis>
[Your detailed step-by-step analysis following the guidelines above]
</tech_news_analysis>

<action>create</action> OR <action>modify</action> OR <action>none</action>

[If action is create or modify, include the additional information as specified above]

Please proceed with your analysis and decision based on the news and product information provided.
