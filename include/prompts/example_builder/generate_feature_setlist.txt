{preamble}

Your job is to generate a list of stages based on the design plan provided in the context. The point of each stage is to implement a simple set of basic functionality for the example, based on the provided files and headers from the design plan. You should shoot for a list of about 5-10 features. Each stage should have the following:

stage_description (str): A high level description of what this stage will implement correctly

files_to_edit (List[str]): A list of files that will be edited in this stage.

success_command (str): A command to run over the code to test the success of the stage.

success_criteria (str): A description of the success criteria for the stage, i.e. what the output should be when running the success command.

Here are some preliminary files that have been created that are successfully built with the command `{build_command}`:

<code_files>
{code_files}
</code_files>

Please output the list of stages in tags, with each stage being a tag. Below you can find an example of a list of stages.

<stage_1>
    <stage_description>
    [the high level description]
    </stage_description>

    <files_to_edit>
    [file_to_edit_1, file_to_edit_2, ...]
    </files_to_edit>

    <success_command>
    [the actual success command]
    </success_command>

    <success_criteria>
    [The description of the success command]
    </success_criteria>
</stage_1>

<stage_2>
// follow the same format for stage 2 and beyond
</stage_2>
