{preamble}

Your job is to create a design and implementation plan for implementing a new coding example, given a few news sources as well as a decision on whether we should 'create' a new example or 'modify' an existing one.

Here is the action to take, and the reasoning behind it:
<action_context>
{action_context}
</action_context>

Generate a design and implementation document that outlines the following sections:
1. The codng language to use, based on the news sources. Restrict to either Python or Typescript.
2. How this example will integrate the existing codebase with the relevant news sources.
3. The code file structure for the example, as well as module imports for each file.
4. The various function headers and descriptions for the example.
5. How we will test this example incrementally, given that we have a tool that can run or build the example in a sandbox environment.
