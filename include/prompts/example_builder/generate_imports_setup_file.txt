{preamble}

You will be provided with a code design and implementation plan, which has a list of code files, function headers, and a design plan.   You will need to generate a requirements.txt or package.json file, and a build command that will be used to install the dependencies for the code files. 

Make sure to generate a requirements.txt if the code files are python, and a package.json if the code files are in typescript. Output the file within the tags <requirements.txt>[setup file path]</requirements.txt> (or <package.json>[setup file path]</package.json> if typescript), and the build command within the tags <buildcommand>[build command]</buildcommand>.

The design plan is:
<plan>
{plan}
</plan>

IMPORTANT NOTE: Use the tools at your disposal to test whether the build command succeeds. You may not continue until the build command succeeds.

Here is an example of how your output should look:

<requirements.txt>
openai
supabase
fastapi==0.100.0
hypercorn==0.14.4
</requirements.txt>

<buildcommand>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</buildcommand>
