{preamble}

Your goal is to modify existing examples to ensure they are up-to-date, follow best practices, and include the latest supported features.

Here's the information you'll be working with:

1. New technology description:
<new_technology>
{new_technology}
</new_technology>

2. Existing example code:
<existing_example>
{existing_example}
</existing_example>

Your task is to analyze the existing example, incorporate the new technology, and provide updated code files. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the existing example and the new technology.
2. Identify which files need to be modified and what changes are required.
3. Make the necessary modifications, ensuring:
   a. Best practices for the programming language are followed.
   b. The example is up-to-date with the provided new technology.
   c. The example uses the latest supported features of {product_name}.
   d. Modifications are concise and include only necessary changes.
4. Create a README.md file with setup instructions.
5. Provide environment configuration (e.g., requirements.txt, package.json).
6. Ensure the modified code can be executed in a sandbox environment.

Before producing the final output, wrap your analysis and planning process inside <analysis_and_planning> tags. Include the following steps:

a. Analyze the existing code and new technology:
   - Summarize the key features of the existing code
   - Identify how the new technology can be integrated

b. List files to modify or create:
   - Number each file, e.g., 1. example.py, 2. README.md, etc.

c. Plan specific modifications for each file:
   - Outline the changes needed for each file listed in step b

d. Verify best practices and up-to-date features:
   - List specific best practices you'll implement
   - Note any outdated features that need updating

e. Outline README.md content:
   - Provide a brief structure for the README.md file

f. Plan environment setup:
   - List required dependencies and their versions

g. Consider sandbox execution:
   - Note any potential issues with sandbox execution and how to address them

After your analysis and planning process, provide the updated example in the following format:

<updated_example>
<file_name>path/to/file1.ext</file_name>
[Contents of file1]

<file_name>path/to/file2.ext</file_name>
[Contents of file2]

<file_name>README.md</file_name>
[Contents of README.md]

<file_name>environment_config_file</file_name>
[Contents of environment configuration file]
</updated_example>

Ensure that you include all modified files, the README.md, and the environment configuration file in your output.

Example output structure:

<analysis_and_planning>
[Your detailed analysis and planning process following the steps outlined above]
</analysis_and_planning>

<updated_example>
<file_name>example.py</file_name>
# Updated example code
import new_technology

def main():
    # Implementation using new technology
    pass

<file_name>README.md</file_name>
# Example Project

## Setup Instructions
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the example: `python example.py`

## New Technology Integration
This example demonstrates the use of [new technology name] for [brief description].

<file_name>requirements.txt</file_name>
new_technology==1.0.0
other_dependency==2.3.4
</updated_example>

Examples for reference:

<examples>
<example_1>

<inputs>
<existing_example>
<main.py>import numpy as np
from {product_name} import interact_with

# Create array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Ask for user approval before proceeding
approval = input("Would you like to proceed with the array transformation? (yes/no): ")

if approval.lower() == 'yes':
    # Perform the transformation
    result = interact_with(array)
    print(f"Transformation complete: {result}")
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user")</main.py>

<requirements.txt>{product_name}==0.0.1 # all libraries are most up to date as of 2025-01-01
numpy==2.2.1
langchain==0.41.4</requirements.txt>

<README.md># Array Transformation with User Approval

This example demonstrates how to use {product_name} to transform NumPy arrays with a simple user approval flow.

## Features
- Creates a basic NumPy array
- Implements a user approval checkpoint before transformation
- Demonstrates basic array transformation using {product_name}

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

The python version at the time of this example being created is 3.12.1</README.md>
</existing_example>

<{new_technology}>
[some data]
Meet interrupt from LangChain
Inspired by Python's input, interrupt pauses a graph, marks it as interrupted, and saves input into the persistence layer:

response = interrupt("Your question here")
You can resume execution when ready:

graph.invoke(Command(resume="Your response here"), thread)  
Unlike input, interrupt works in production, freeing up resources and enabling workflows to pick up where they left off.

Use Cases
Approve/Reject: Review critical steps before execution.

Edit State: Correct or enhance the graph state.

Review Tool Calls: Verify LLM outputs.

Multi-Turn Conversations: Enable dynamic, interactive dialogues.

<code_files>
<updated_example>
<fpath_main.py>import numpy as np
from langchain.callbacks import HumanApprovalCallbackHandler
from {product_name} import interact_with, interrupt

# Create array and callback handler
array = np.array([1, 2, 3])
approval_callback = HumanApprovalCallbackHandler()

# Initialize interaction with human approval
result = interact_with(
    array,
    callbacks=[approval_callback]
)

# Add human-in-the-loop checkpoint
response = interrupt("Would you like to proceed with the array transformation?")

if response.lower() == 'yes':
    # Continue with transformation
    final_result = result.resume()
    print(f"Transformation complete: {final_result}")
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user")</main.py>

<fpath_requirements.txt>{product_name}==0.0.1 # all libraries are most up to date as of 2025-01-01
numpy==2.2.1
langchain==0.42.1</fpath_requirements.txt>

<fpath_README.md># Numpy Guide with Human-in-the-Loop

This example shows how to use numpy to create an array and properly link it to {product_name}, with added human approval steps.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

The example will now pause for human approval before completing the array transformation.
