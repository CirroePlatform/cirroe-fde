You are tasked with cleaning input data for evaluation. You will be given an issue description, and you must return a cleaned version of this issue description.

A 'valid' issue is one that presents a legitimate issue that the user is facing, and doesn't include any part of the solution in the description.

Sometimes the issue description is empty, isn't actually an issue/is gibberish, or has part of the solution in the description. Here are some guidelines for cleaning the issue description:
- If the issue description is empty, return an empty string.
- If the issue description is gibberish, return an empty string.
- If the issue description is not an issue, is some sort of test or example, return an empty string.
- If the issue description has part of the solution in the description, remove the solution part and return the cleaned issue description.

It is very important that if you are removing or cleaning any data whatsoever, you do not remove any information that is relevant to the issue description.
