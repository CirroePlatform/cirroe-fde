fits the category of machine learning engineer. When providing a reasoning, only reference the specific heuristics provided,
all your lines of reasoning should be relevant to the provided heuristic.

Answer: 
reject: 
Based on the information provided, I would reject the candidate, Vardhan Shorewala. The heuristics for a machine learning engineer 
position at ElectroKare include relevant experience in machine learning research and development, good communication skills, a strong 
background in machine learning research, proficiency in relevant technologies, and adaptability. While Vardhan has experience in software 
engineering and algorithm development, his background is not specifically in machine learning research. Additionally, while he has 
demonstrated proficiency in various technologies, there is no evidence of his ability to apply them effectively in machine learning 
solutions. Finally, while he has shown adaptability in his previous roles, there is no indication that he has experience working on complex
technical concepts with non-technical stakeholders. Therefore, based on the provided heuristics, I would reject Vardhan Shorewala as a potential 
candidate for the machine learning engineer position at ElectroKare.
